changes from original schema:

- items: made dimensions into 3 different fields (could potentially change this back?)

- deliveryorder: made it a DATE type, added delivery date (which can be null if enroute)
	changed DATE to initial_date (name conflict with type) 
	added delivery_date (can be null; updated when delivered)

- postofficeservicedby: changed PK to POID (previous PK could not be unique and caused errors)


queries (requirements are in milestone 5 rubric):

-insert: new deliveryorder

-delete: an employee (cascades to workarea)

-update: status of package

-selection: select customer id's where address is the same

-projection: select all undelivered packages for a certain order

-join: customers whose orders were placed with an employee

-aggregate: maximum amount of time to get a package from one zip to another

-nested aggregate: average number of items per deliveryorder

-division: ???
